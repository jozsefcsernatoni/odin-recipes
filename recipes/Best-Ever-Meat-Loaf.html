        Steps
    </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
        </li>
        <li>
            Whisk eggs, milk, salt, and ground black pepper in a large bowl. Add crumbled bread and stir until dissolved. Mix ground beef, onion, Cheddar cheese, and carrot into bread mixture; transfer mixture to a 9x5-inch loaf pan.
        </li>
        <li>
            Combine brown sugar, ketchup, and mustard in a small bowl; spread over the meat mixture.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, 60 to 75 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
